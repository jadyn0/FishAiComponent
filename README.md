# FishAiComponent

This component makes fish move around in a semi realistic way. The movement is inspired by how fish move in the game animal crossing new horizons, in which after a random interval the fish will either move forward and turn slightly, or turn a larger amount. the fish have a ray in which they detect if they are going to swim into something, and if they are they will turn to face a different direction.
